Crystal Collector:

This unit-4 assignment for homework as assigned by the UCSD Extension Coding Bootcamp was one of our early javascript assignments where we were tasked with creating a functioning game as a browser based app. Using a blank html with css styling, and the assistance of Bootstrap and providing the functionality of the site via javascript and jQuery, the task was to create a game whereupon each play the user was given a numerical goal between 20-120 to reach and had four inputs available in the form of four gems they can click. During each session of play the gems are assigned a random value which the user can only figure out by watching their visible score as it rises up from 0. The goal is to match their score exactly to the target score for each round. If the user score goes over the target score the round is lost and the game will keep track of rounds won or lost. 

I decided to add the functionality of an additional "feeling lucky" button to give myself a small extra challenge and also to make gameplay slightly more interesting for the user if they chose. I relied on bootstrap for layout quite a bit for this assignment and found the bulk of the task to be exposure to targeting elements and displaying elements at the correct time within the script.
